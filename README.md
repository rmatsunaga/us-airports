# Airports in the US

The project shows a webmap (link found [here](https://rmatsunaga.github.io/us-airports/)) showing a map of the United States with Airports shown. The map functions to present airports around the United States, show the separations with the state, show the states' number of airports, and indicate if airports have a control tower or not.

Libraries used include leaflet, font awesome, and chroma. Data sources are from United States Open Data, and [Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/).
